# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a revolutionary trading bot that exploits hidden market inefficiencies and predictable patterns that 99% of traders completely miss. The bot will focus on high-probability, low-risk opportunities with measurable edges including whale tracking, exchange arbitrage, liquidation prediction, and regulatory front-running. This isn't about predicting markets - it's about exploiting guaranteed mathematical advantages.
