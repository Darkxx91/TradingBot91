# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building an advanced trading bot system that can execute automated trading strategies with risk management, technical analysis, and performance tracking capabilities. The bot will be designed to implement proven trading methodologies while maintaining strict risk controls and providing comprehensive monitoring and reporting features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Market Data Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to access real-time market data from multiple sources, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL connect to at least one major market data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or broker API)
2. WHEN market data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve real-time price data within 5 seconds
3. WHEN historical data is needed THEN the system SHALL fetch at least 1 year of historical price data for analysis
4. IF the primary data source fails THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to a backup data source
5. WHEN data is received THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and reject corrupted or incomplete data

### Requirement 2: Technical Analysis Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to perform technical analysis using proven indicators, so that I can identify trading opportunities based on market patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing price data THEN the system SHALL calculate moving averages (SMA, EMA) for multiple timeframes
2. WHEN evaluating momentum THEN the system SHALL compute RSI, MACD, and Stochastic indicators
3. WHEN identifying trends THEN the system SHALL detect support and resistance levels
4. WHEN pattern recognition is needed THEN the system SHALL identify common chart patterns (triangles, head and shoulders, etc.)
5. WHEN multiple indicators conflict THEN the system SHALL use a weighted scoring system to determine overall signal strength

### Requirement 3: Trading Strategy Implementation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to execute multiple proven trading strategies automatically, so that I can capitalize on realistic market opportunities with consistent edge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing arbitrage strategy THEN the system SHALL monitor price differences between exchanges and execute trades within 2-second windows
2. WHEN correlation breakdown is detected THEN the system SHALL trade mean reversion between normally correlated assets
3. WHEN market making is active THEN the system SHALL place limit orders on both sides of the order book to capture spreads
4. WHEN social sentiment spikes are detected THEN the system SHALL execute contrarian trades after initial momentum fades
5. WHEN volume profile analysis identifies key levels THEN the system SHALL place orders at high-probability support/resistance zones

### Requirement 4: Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive risk management controls, so that I can protect my capital from significant losses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a position THEN the system SHALL never risk more than 2% of total capital per trade
2. WHEN losses accumulate THEN the system SHALL implement stop-loss orders at predefined levels
3. WHEN daily losses exceed 5% THEN the system SHALL halt all trading until manual review
4. WHEN portfolio exposure exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL reject new position entries
5. IF account balance drops below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts and stop trading

### Requirement 5: Portfolio Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to manage my portfolio allocation and track performance, so that I can maintain optimal diversification and monitor returns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing positions THEN the system SHALL maintain position sizing based on volatility and correlation
2. WHEN rebalancing is needed THEN the system SHALL adjust allocations to maintain target percentages
3. WHEN calculating performance THEN the system SHALL track returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown
4. WHEN positions are held THEN the system SHALL monitor correlation between assets to avoid over-concentration
5. WHEN portfolio metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance analytics

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time monitoring and alerts, so that I can stay informed about bot performance and market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN significant events occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications
2. WHEN system errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and alert administrators
3. WHEN performance metrics change THEN the system SHALL update dashboards in real-time
4. WHEN unusual market conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
5. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation notifications with trade details

### Requirement 7: Backtesting and Strategy Validation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to backtest strategies on historical data, so that I can validate their effectiveness before deploying them with real money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting is initiated THEN the system SHALL run strategies against historical data spanning at least 2 years
2. WHEN backtest completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive performance metrics and statistics
3. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL rank them by risk-adjusted returns
4. WHEN strategy parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL re-run backtests automatically
5. WHEN backtest results are generated THEN the system SHALL include transaction costs and slippage in calculations

### Requirement 8: Social Sentiment Analysis Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to analyze social media sentiment and news events, so that I can capitalize on predictable market reactions to information flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring social sentiment THEN the system SHALL track Twitter, Reddit, and news mentions for configured assets
2. WHEN sentiment spikes are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate sentiment momentum and fade signals
3. WHEN news events occur THEN the system SHALL identify overreactions and position for mean reversion
4. WHEN social volume increases dramatically THEN the system SHALL prepare contrarian positions after initial momentum
5. WHEN sentiment analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL combine sentiment scores with technical indicators

### Requirement 9: Order Book and Market Microstructure Analysis

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to analyze order book depth and market microstructure, so that I can identify high-probability entry and exit points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing order book THEN the system SHALL identify significant support and resistance levels from volume profiles
2. WHEN large orders appear THEN the system SHALL detect institutional activity and position accordingly
3. WHEN bid-ask spreads widen THEN the system SHALL adjust market making strategies to capture increased spreads
4. WHEN order flow imbalances occur THEN the system SHALL predict short-term price movements
5. WHEN market depth changes THEN the system SHALL adjust position sizing based on liquidity availability

### Requirement 10: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to configure trading parameters and customize strategies, so that I can adapt the bot to different market conditions and personal preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the bot THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all key parameters through a user interface
2. WHEN strategy settings change THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and prevent invalid configurations
3. WHEN multiple trading pairs are selected THEN the system SHALL manage settings independently for each pair
4. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL create backups and version history
5. WHEN loading configurations THEN the system SHALL validate settings compatibility with current market conditions
