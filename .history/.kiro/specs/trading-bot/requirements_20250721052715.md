# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building an advanced trading bot system that can execute automated trading strategies with risk management, technical analysis, and performance tracking capabilities. The bot will be designed to implement proven trading methodologies while maintaining strict risk controls and providing comprehensive monitoring and reporting features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Market Data Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to access real-time market data from multiple sources, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL connect to at least one major market data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or broker API)
2. WHEN market data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve real-time price data within 5 seconds
3. WHEN historical data is needed THEN the system SHALL fetch at least 1 year of historical price data for analysis
4. IF the primary data source fails THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to a backup data source
5. WHEN data is received THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and reject corrupted or incomplete data

### Requirement 2: Technical Analysis Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to perform technical analysis using proven indicators, so that I can identify trading opportunities based on market patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing price data THEN the system SHALL calculate moving averages (SMA, EMA) for multiple timeframes
2. WHEN evaluating momentum THEN the system SHALL compute RSI, MACD, and Stochastic indicators
3. WHEN identifying trends THEN the system SHALL detect support and resistance levels
4. WHEN pattern recognition is needed THEN the system SHALL identify common chart patterns (triangles, head and shoulders, etc.)
5. WHEN multiple indicators conflict THEN the system SHALL use a weighted scoring system to determine overall signal strength

### Requirement 3: Trading Strategy Implementation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to execute predefined trading strategies automatically, so that I can capitalize on market opportunities without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buy signal is generated THEN the system SHALL execute a market or limit order based on strategy configuration
2. WHEN a sell signal is triggered THEN the system SHALL close positions according to exit rules
3. WHEN multiple strategies are active THEN the system SHALL manage position sizing across all strategies
4. IF market conditions change THEN the system SHALL adjust strategy parameters dynamically
5. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL log all trade details with timestamps

### Requirement 4: Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive risk management controls, so that I can protect my capital from significant losses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a position THEN the system SHALL never risk more than 2% of total capital per trade
2. WHEN losses accumulate THEN the system SHALL implement stop-loss orders at predefined levels
3. WHEN daily losses exceed 5% THEN the system SHALL halt all trading until manual review
4. WHEN portfolio exposure exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL reject new position entries
5. IF account balance drops below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts and stop trading

### Requirement 5: Portfolio Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the bot to manage my portfolio allocation and track performance, so that I can maintain optimal diversification and monitor returns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing positions THEN the system SHALL maintain position sizing based on volatility and correlation
2. WHEN rebalancing is needed THEN the system SHALL adjust allocations to maintain target percentages
3. WHEN calculating performance THEN the system SHALL track returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown
4. WHEN positions are held THEN the system SHALL monitor correlation between assets to avoid over-concentration
5. WHEN portfolio metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance analytics

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time monitoring and alerts, so that I can stay informed about bot performance and market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN significant events occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications
2. WHEN system errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and alert administrators
3. WHEN performance metrics change THEN the system SHALL update dashboards in real-time
4. WHEN unusual market conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
5. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation notifications with trade details

### Requirement 7: Backtesting and Strategy Validation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to backtest strategies on historical data, so that I can validate their effectiveness before deploying them with real money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting is initiated THEN the system SHALL run strategies against historical data spanning at least 2 years
2. WHEN backtest completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive performance metrics and statistics
3. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL rank them by risk-adjusted returns
4. WHEN strategy parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL re-run backtests automatically
5. WHEN backtest results are generated THEN the system SHALL include transaction costs and slippage in calculations

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to configure trading parameters and customize strategies, so that I can adapt the bot to different market conditions and personal preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the bot THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all key parameters through a user interface
2. WHEN strategy settings change THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and prevent invalid configurations
3. WHEN multiple trading pairs are selected THEN the system SHALL manage settings independently for each pair
4. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL create backups and version history
5. WHEN loading configurations THEN the system SHALL validate settings compatibility with current market conditions
