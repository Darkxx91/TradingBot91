Focus on SPECIFIC execution strategies for: 1) Whale wallet front-running with 500ms execution - which blockchain APIs and wallet addresses to monitor? 2) Stablecoin depeg exploitation with 200x leverage - exact price thresholds and exchange APIs? 3) Meme coin 20-40% pullback patterns - specific social media APIs and timing windows? Give me EXACT technical implementation details with API endpoints, not generic trading advice."
