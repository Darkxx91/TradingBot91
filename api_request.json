I need SPECIFIC technical implementation details for: 1) Monitoring large wallet movements on blockchain - which APIs provide real-time transaction data and what are the exact endpoints? 2) Stablecoin price monitoring for arbitrage opportunities - which exchange APIs show USDT/USDC pricing discrepancies in real-time? 3) Social media sentiment analysis for meme coin pattern detection - which Twitter/Reddit APIs provide real-time data? Give me exact API endpoints, WebSocket connections, and data structures - no generic advice please."
