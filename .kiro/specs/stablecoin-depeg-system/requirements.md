# Stablecoin Depeg Exploitation System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Stablecoin Depeg Exploitation Engine, a revolutionary component of our trading system that capitalizes on temporary deviations of stablecoins from their pegged value. When stablecoins like USDT, USDC, or DAI deviate from their $1.00 peg, they almost always return to peg eventually, creating a mathematical certainty for profit. This system will automatically detect these deviations, calculate optimal position sizes based on depeg magnitude and expected reversion time, and execute trades with appropriate leverage to maximize returns while managing risk.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stablecoin Price Monitoring

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to continuously monitor stablecoin prices across multiple exchanges, so that I can identify depegging events as soon as they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to at least 10 major exchanges that trade stablecoins
2. WHEN monitoring prices THEN the system SHALL track at least USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, and USDC across all connected exchanges
3. WHEN price data is received THEN the system SHALL calculate the deviation from the $1.00 peg with at least 4 decimal places of precision
4. WHEN a stablecoin's price deviates by >0.05% from $1.00 THEN the system SHALL trigger a depeg alert
5. WHEN multiple exchanges show different prices for the same stablecoin THEN the system SHALL track each exchange separately

### Requirement 2: Depeg Event Classification

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to classify depeg events by severity, liquidity, and expected reversion time, so that I can prioritize the most profitable opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a depeg event is detected THEN the system SHALL classify it by magnitude (minor: 0.05-0.2%, moderate: 0.2-1%, severe: >1%)
2. WHEN classifying a depeg THEN the system SHALL analyze available liquidity across all exchanges
3. WHEN analyzing a depeg THEN the system SHALL calculate expected reversion time based on historical patterns
4. WHEN multiple stablecoins depeg simultaneously THEN the system SHALL rank opportunities by expected profit potential
5. WHEN a depeg event occurs THEN the system SHALL determine if it's a discount (price < $1.00) or premium (price > $1.00)

### Requirement 3: Position Sizing and Risk Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to calculate optimal position sizes based on depeg magnitude and available capital, so that I can maximize profits while managing risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a depeg opportunity is identified THEN the system SHALL calculate optimal position size based on account balance and depeg magnitude
2. WHEN determining leverage THEN the system SHALL use higher leverage for smaller deviations and lower leverage for larger deviations
3. WHEN multiple depeg opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL allocate capital based on expected profit and probability of reversion
4. WHEN position size is calculated THEN the system SHALL ensure it never exceeds predefined risk limits
5. WHEN a position is opened THEN the system SHALL set appropriate stop-loss levels to limit potential losses if the depeg worsens

### Requirement 4: Execution Strategy

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to execute trades with optimal timing and across multiple exchanges, so that I can capture the best prices and maximize liquidity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a depeg trade THEN the system SHALL split orders across multiple exchanges if needed to minimize slippage
2. WHEN a stablecoin is trading at a discount THEN the system SHALL buy the discounted stablecoin and simultaneously sell an equivalent amount of a properly pegged stablecoin
3. WHEN a stablecoin is trading at a premium THEN the system SHALL sell the premium stablecoin and simultaneously buy an equivalent amount of a properly pegged stablecoin
4. WHEN executing trades THEN the system SHALL prioritize exchanges with the highest liquidity and largest price deviation
5. WHEN market conditions change during execution THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust orders to optimize execution

### Requirement 5: Exit Strategy and Profit Taking

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically exit positions when the stablecoin returns to peg, so that I can secure profits without constant monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stablecoin begins reverting toward its peg THEN the system SHALL monitor the reversion rate to determine optimal exit timing
2. WHEN a stablecoin reaches within 0.02% of its peg THEN the system SHALL close the position to secure profits
3. WHEN a position has been open for longer than the expected reversion time THEN the system SHALL reevaluate the position
4. WHEN market conditions suggest the depeg may worsen THEN the system SHALL implement a partial exit strategy to secure some profits
5. WHEN a position is closed THEN the system SHALL record detailed performance metrics for analysis

### Requirement 6: Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to integrate with the cross-exchange arbitrage engine, so that I can exploit price differences of the same stablecoin across different exchanges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same stablecoin has different prices across exchanges THEN the system SHALL execute arbitrage trades
2. WHEN arbitrage opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL calculate transaction costs including withdrawal/deposit fees
3. WHEN executing cross-exchange arbitrage THEN the system SHALL account for withdrawal/deposit times between exchanges
4. WHEN arbitrage opportunities persist THEN the system SHALL execute repeated trades until the opportunity disappears
5. WHEN cross-exchange opportunities exist alongside depeg opportunities THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on expected profit

### Requirement 7: Flash Loan Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to integrate with the flash loan engine, so that I can amplify returns on high-confidence depeg opportunities without additional capital risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high-confidence depeg opportunity is identified THEN the system SHALL evaluate potential for flash loan amplification
2. WHEN using flash loans THEN the system SHALL ensure the expected profit exceeds loan fees and gas costs
3. WHEN executing a flash loan depeg trade THEN the system SHALL complete the entire transaction atomically
4. WHEN flash loan opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL calculate optimal loan amount for maximum profit
5. WHEN flash loan protocols change THEN the system SHALL adapt to new interfaces automatically

### Requirement 8: Historical Analysis and Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to analyze historical depeg events, so that it can identify patterns and improve prediction accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new depeg event occurs THEN the system SHALL compare it to historical events to predict behavior
2. WHEN analyzing historical data THEN the system SHALL identify correlations between market conditions and depeg events
3. WHEN patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL adjust its strategy parameters automatically
4. WHEN historical analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate success rates for different depeg scenarios
5. WHEN new data becomes available THEN the system SHALL continuously update its prediction models

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerts for depeg events, so that I can stay informed about system performance and market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a significant depeg event occurs THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications
2. WHEN positions are opened or closed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed trade information
3. WHEN system performance metrics change THEN the system SHALL update dashboards in real-time
4. WHEN unusual depeg patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators for manual review
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery status

### Requirement 10: Performance Tracking and Optimization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want detailed performance tracking and strategy optimization, so that the system can continuously improve its depeg exploitation effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL record detailed performance metrics
2. WHEN sufficient performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL identify optimization opportunities
3. WHEN strategy parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL compare performance before and after changes
4. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt strategy parameters automatically
5. WHEN new stablecoins emerge THEN the system SHALL evaluate and incorporate them into the monitoring system
